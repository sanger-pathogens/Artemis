# INTRODUCTION

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sanger-pathogens/Artemis.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sanger-pathogens/Artemis)

Artemis is a free genome browser and annotation tool that allows visualisation 
of sequence features, next generation data and the results of analyses within 
the context of the sequence, and also its six-frame translation.  Artemis is written 
in Java, and is available for UNIX, Macintosh and Windows systems. It can read 
EMBL and GENBANK database entries or sequence in FASTA, indexed FASTA or raw format. 
Other sequence features can be in EMBL, GENBANK or GFF format.

ACT is a free tool for displaying pairwise comparisons between two or more DNA 
sequences. It can be used to identify and analyse regions of similarity and 
difference between genomes and to explore conservation of synteny, in the context 
of the entire sequences and their annotation.
