    <PARA>
&prog; is a DNA sequence comparison viewer based on <ULINK
URL="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/artemis/"
type="external">Artemis</ULINK>.  The name &prog; stands for Artemis
Comparison Tool.  &prog; is written in Java, reads EMBL or GENBANK format
sequences and feature tables, and can work on sequences of any size.
    </PARA>

&prog; understands several different comparison file formats.  See <XREF
LINKEND="COMPARISON-RUN"> for details.  Note that &prog; is a comparison
viewer only.  The comparison information itself must be generated externally.
See <XREF LINKEND="COMPARISON-RUN"> for more details.

      <PARA>
Change directory to the directory you wish to install &prog; in.  We will use
<LITERAL>~/</LITERAL> in this example and in the next chapter.  Uncompress and
untar the <LITERAL>act_compiled.tar.gz</LITERAL> file.  The command
is:
      </PARA>
      <PARA>
         <COMMAND>
tar zxf act_compiled.tar.gz
         </COMMAND>
      </PARA>
      <PARA>
This will create a directory called <LITERAL>~/act</LITERAL> which will
contain all the files necessity for running &prog;.

    <SECT2 ID="MACINSTALLATION">
      <TITLE>Installation Instructions for MacOSX</TITLE>
      <PARA>
For MacOSX users an archive artemis_act.dmg.gz disk image is provided.
This contains both Artemis and ACT applications.
This can be uncompressed using gunzip:
      </PARA>
      <PARA>
<ComputerOutput>gunzip artemis_act.dmg.gz</ComputerOutput>
      </PARA>
      <PARA>
Alternatively on OS X an easier solution is provided by StuffIt Expander.
Double-click on any file ending in ".gz" and StuffIt Expander will be
launched to uncompress that file.

      <PARA>
On Windows systems with Java (version 1.6 or higher), installing &prog;
is as simple as downloading the the act.jar file to an appropriate 
place (such as the desktop or the Programs folder). When downloading
some versions of windows mistake this file for a zip file ensure it
does not name this act.zip, if it does rename it to act.jar 
(DO NOT UNZIP THIS FILE).
