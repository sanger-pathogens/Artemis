Most of the items in this menu are used to read and write entries and parts of
entries, the exceptions are Clone and Close.

  <SECT2 ID="FILEMENU-SHOW-FILEMANAGER">
    <TITLE>Show File Manager ...</TITLE>
    <PARA>

to the foreground. Entries can be dragged from the file manager into
the artemis main window and dropped. When dropped the entry is then read 
in and displayed.

  <SECT2 ID="FILEMENU-READ-AN-ENTRY">
    <TITLE>Read An Entry ...</TITLE>
    <PARA>
Read an entry (see <XREF LINKEND="CONCEPTS-ENTRY">), but keep it separate from
the others.  A new button will be created on the entry button line for the new
entry.  The new entry will be marked as active (see <XREF
LINKEND="CONCEPTS-ACTIVEENTRY">) and will be the new default entry (see <XREF
LINKEND="CONCEPTS-DEFAULTENTRY">).
    </PARA>
    <PARA>
See <XREF LINKEND="FILETYPES">.
This function only reads the feature section of the input file - the sequence
(if any) is ignored.
    </PARA>

  <SECT2 ID="FILEMENU-READ-ENTRY-INTO">
    <TITLE>Read Entry Into</TITLE>
    <PARA>

chosen by the user and then insert them into the entry selected by
the user.

  <SECT2 ID="FILEMENU-SAVE-DEFAULT-ENTRY">
    <TITLE>Save Default Entry</TITLE>
    <PARA>
Save the default entry to the file it came from, unless the entry has been
given a new name, in which case the entry is saved to a file with that name.
If the entry has no name, &prog; will prompt the user for a new name.

header of a GENBANK entry can't be converted to the equivalent EMBL header (it
will be discarded instead).

    <SECT3 ID="FILEMENU-SAVE-EMBL-SUBMISSION">
      <TITLE>EMBL Submission Format</TITLE>
      <PARA>
This does the same as "Save An Entry As -> EMBL Format ...", but
will write an entry/tab file that contains only valid EMBL qualifiers (see
<XREF LINKEND="OPTIONS-EXTRAQUALIFIERS">) and valid EMBL keys (see <XREF
LINKEND="OPTIONS-EXTRAKEYS">).  It will also check that the start and stop
codons of each CDS are sensible, that no two features have the same key and
location and that all required EMBL qualifiers are present.

      <TITLE>Bases Of Selection</TITLE>
      <PARA>
Prompt for a file name and then write the bases of the selection to that
file in the selected format.  If the selection consists of features (rather
than a base range) then the bases of each feature
will be written to the file as a separate record.  If the selection is a range
of bases, then those bases will be written.

each selected feature to the file in the selected format.  For example if the
selected feature has a
location of "<LITERAL>100..200</LITERAL>", then asking for 50 upstream will
write the bases in the range 50 to 99.  Writing upstream bases of a feature on
the complementary strand will work in the expected way.

SVG (scalable vector graphics) is an XML based vector image format.
These images can be converted to a raster image (e.g. png, tiff) at any resolution by
exporting it from applications such as Inkscape (http://inkscape.org/) or gimp (http://www.gimp.org/).
Therfore the SVG format can be useful for creating publication quality figures.
