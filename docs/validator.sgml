open a report window highlighting any features which have failed the checks.

Select the features to be checked in &prog; and open the popup menu by right clicking on the feature display 
and selecting the 'Validation report ...' option.

      <PARA>
From the View menu, select the 'Feature Filters' menu item and the 'Validation checks...' option. This opens
a feature list window for each of the type of check it carries out and these contain the features that have
failed the check.

For organisms in a chado database the vaidator can be run from the 'Database and File Manager' window from the 
'File' menu by selecting the 'Validate Selected Sequence / Organism' option.

   <PARA>
The validation report window displays a summary for the features that have failed one or
more of the annotation checks above. The title bar of the window displays the number of 
features that have passed and the number that have failed the validation checks. The 
problems identified are highlighted in red.

   <PARA>
Some of the errors can be fixed automatically. The 'Auto-Fix' button opens a window
with the fixes enabled that are available for the entry type that is loaded in &prog;. For example, it will
attempt to fix CDS features that have been found not to end in stop codons. If the last codon is not a 
stop codon, but the very next codon is a stop codon, then the end of the feature is 
extended by three bases.
   </PARA>
   <PARA>
For GFF3 and chado entries &prog; will also attempt to fix problems it finds with gene
boundaries and if a phase is absent then a default phase of 0 is given. Once these are
fixed the results window will automatically update and remove the problems it has
managed to resolved.
