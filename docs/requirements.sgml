&prog; will run on any machine that has a recent version of Java.
This version of &prog; requires Java 1.6 at least. Most of the
development has been done using JDK v1.6 and some of the more 
advanced features (BamView and VCF/BCF View) require Java 1.6 or higher. 
See <XREF LINKEND="INSTALLATION"> for details on how to get Java.
