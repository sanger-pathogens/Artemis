    <TITLE>Running &prog; on UNIX and GNU/Linux Systems</TITLE>
    <PARA>
On Unix and GNU/Linux the easiest way to run the program is to run the script
called <COMMAND>art</COMMAND> in the &prog; installation directory (see <XREF
LINKEND="INSTALLATION">), like this:
    </PARA>

    <PARA>
      <COMMAND>artemis/art</COMMAND>
    </PARA>

    <PARA>
If all goes well you will be presented with a small window with three
menus.  See <XREF LINKEND="LAUNCH-WINDOW"> to find out what to do next.
    </PARA>

    <PARA>
Alternatively you start &prog; with the name of a sequence file or embl file
eg:
    </PARA>

    <PARA>
      <COMMAND>artemis/art artemis/etc/c1215.embl</COMMAND>
    </PARA>

    <PARA>
Or if you have a sequence file and extra feature table files you can read
them all with a command like this (the example file c1215.blastn.tab is the
result of a BLASTN search against EMBL which has been converted to feature
table format):
    </PARA>

    <PARA>
      <COMMAND>
artemis/art artemis/etc/c1215.embl + artemis/etc/c1215.blastn.tab
      </COMMAND> 
    </PARA>
    <PARA>
Note that any number of feature files can be read by listing them after the
plus sign.  The "+" must be surrounded by spaces.
    </PARA>

    <PARA>
See <XREF LINKEND="UNIXARGS"> for a list of the other possible arguments. Also
to see a summary of the options type:

   <PARA>
      <COMMAND>artemis/art -help</COMMAND>
   </PARA>

    <PARA>
Here is an alternative way to run &prog; if the <COMMAND>art</COMMAND> script
doesn't work for you:
    </PARA>

    <PARA>
      <COMMAND>
cd ~/artemis
      </COMMAND>
    </PARA>

  <SECT1 ID="RUNNINGMAC">
    <TITLE>Running &prog; on Macintosh Systems</TITLE>
    <PARA>
On MacOSX machines &prog; can be started by double clicking on the Artemis
icon. The icon can be added to the dock by dragging it from a 'Finder' window
and dropping it onto the position in the dock you want it. In addition
sequence files (with gff, embl, EMBL, genbank, gbk, fasta, seq, art file name
extensions) can be dragged and dropped on to the Artemis application image to 
open them up.
    </PARA>
    <PARA>
To change the memory allocated to &prog; on MacOSX, set the value in the file Info.plist 
in the directory Artemis.app/Contents. Towards the bottom of the file there are a couple of 
lines that look like this:
<SYNOPSIS>
 &lt;key&gt;VMOptions&lt;/key&gt;
 &lt;string&gt;-Xmx800m&lt;/string&gt;
</SYNOPSIS>
 Changing the value after -Xmx will change the memory used by &prog;.

you to open a flat file containing an entry.  If the file you select is
successfully read a new window will open, which shows the sequence and
