Installation instructions for UNIX

   1. change to /some/directory

   2. uncompress and untar the artemis_compiled.tar.gz file
      On UNIX the command is:   gzip -d < artemis_compiled.tar.gz | tar xf -


This will create a "artemis" directory containing all the java classes.  On
Unix the easiest way to run the program is to run the script called art in the
diana directory:

    /some/directory/artemis/art

If all goes well you will be presented with a small window with two
menus.  From the File menu you can open a flat file containing an
entry.  If it reads the entry successfully a new window will open,
which shows the sequence and features for the entry.
